I'm passionate about building high-performing engineering teams and innovative platforms that empower developers to excel. With deep experience in Platform Engineering, Observability, AI-driven workflows, and modern software architectures, my goal is to foster environments where technology and teams thrive together.

### 🚀 What I'm Doing
- **Director of Engineering**: Leading dynamic full-stack teams in developing a robust internal developer platform built on Spotify's Backstage, standardizing practices, and embedding AI to elevate engineering productivity.
- **Thought Leader in Engineering Excellence**: Authored "[Microservices In Real Life: Contract Testing](https://fidildev.gumroad.com/l/contract-testing)", hosted a webinar on "[Making Your Observability Costs Predictable](https://www.honeycomb.io/making-observability-costs-predictable-webinar)", and shared insights on transforming engineering culture through observability ([Case Study](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/pax8-modern-observability-2-0-solution)).

### 📚 Always Learning
I am continually exploring the intersection of AI and software engineering, platform engineering best practices, and optimizing developer experience through modern tools and automation.
